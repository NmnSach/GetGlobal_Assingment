# GetGlobal_Assingment

The project simply allows the user to enter their email in the input field and stores the email in a mongoDB database.

Download the project files and run sever and react-app separately. Also, make sure you have your MongoDB set up and node modules installed.

# To Run 

- In the react-app, open the terminal and run the command -- npm install react-scripts --save

- In the server, open the terminal and run the command - npm i express mongoose cors body-parser

Once both of these are done, you can visit localhost:3000 in your browser, type the email in the input field and check your console as well as your mongoDB for the stored email.
